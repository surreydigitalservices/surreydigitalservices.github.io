For the past eight years, the Surrey Digital Services (SDS) Address API has been an invaluable resource for our customers, delivering accurate and reliable address data. However, due to the introduction of the Ordnance Survey Data Hub services in recent years and the need to address financial pressures, we regret to inform you that the Surrey Digital Services Address API will be discontinued as of September 1, 2024.

To minimize any operational impact, you will need to take appropriate action before this date, as it is non-negotiable. Please note that we will not be responsible for any disruptions to your services after September 1, 2024.

Since we are not aware of how or where you use the SDS Address API, we are unable to offer specific advice or assistance on transitioning. However, please note that the Ordnance Survey Data Hub provides comprehensive address data and mapping services to PSGA members, exceeding the coverage provided by the SDS Address API.

Best regards,
On behalf of Surrey Digital Services
